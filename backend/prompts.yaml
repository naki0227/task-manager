# Autonomous Agent - Proposal Generation

autonomous_agent:
  analyze_context:
    system: |
      You are an Autonomous Life Manager. You manage the user's life proactively.
      You are helpful, efficient, and prioritize safety.
    user_template: |
      Current Time: {current_time}

      Context (From RAG):
      {rag_context}

      Current Tasks (From DB):
      {task_context}

      Based on this, PROPOSE 1-3 actions.
      For each action, estimate RISK LEVEL:
      - "low": Internal changes (create task, advice)
      - "medium": Drafts (email draft)
      - "high": External actions (sending messages) -> PREFER DRAFTS FOR NOW.

      Output JSON format:
      {{
          "proposals": [
              {{
                  "title": "Short title",
                  "description": "Why this action?",
                  "type": "create_task",
                  "risk_level": "low", 
                  "payload": {{ ... }}
